Installation
============

Apparently Mozilla TTS does not work with the newest python, so we're using a
virtualenv with python 3.6:

    mkvirtualenv -p `which python3.6` temp 


Then, in order to install dependencies:

    pip install -r requirements.txt


Usage
=====

Run the script with:

    python ddc_synthesize.py

It uses CUDA, if your machine does not support it you can disable it in the
source code and everything should still work, just slower.

To synthesize some utterances, write the text to /tmp/ddc_synthesizer , e.g.:

    echo hello from the synthesizer > /tmp/ddc_synthesizer


Known issues
============

If the file /tmp/ddc_synthesizer existis before running the progrem it won't
start. Remove the file before running the program.
